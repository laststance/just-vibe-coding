## What is Just Vibe Coding?

**Just Vibe Coding** is a VS Code extension that provides a friction-free space for writing code — no project context, no goals, no pressure.

- 🧠 Start coding before you think
- 🫧 Failure, destruction, and incompleteness are allowed
- 🎧 Console responds like a companion

## Features

- **One Command**: `Just Vibe Coding: Start` — that's all you need
- **Isolated Environment**: Each session lives in `~/.just-vibe-coding/sessions/`
- **Instant Execution**: Save to run, see output immediately
- **Zero Config**: No settings, no choices, no setup

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0+
- Node.js 22+ (for native TypeScript execution)

## Usage

1. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type `Just Vibe Coding: Start`
3. A new window opens with `vibe.js`
4. Write code, save (`Cmd+S`), see output
5. That's it. Just vibe.

## What This Extension Does NOT Do

By design, **Just Vibe Coding** does NOT provide:

- ❌ Project management
- ❌ Framework selection
- ❌ Templates
- ❌ Linting / Formatting / Testing
- ❌ Documentation generation
- ❌ Productivity metrics

These features would break the vibe.

## Philosophy

> Code is like talking. But we've made it feel like public speaking.

Just Vibe Coding is for:
- Warming up before work
- When your mind is cluttered
- When you have no ideas but want to move your hands

It's a space for **coding small talk**.
